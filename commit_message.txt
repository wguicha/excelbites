feat: Enhance formula test & internationalize UI

This commit introduces several improvements to the XLOOKUP lesson:

- Refactored formatting logic into `excelFormatters.js` for better code structure.
- Added a new `setRangeFillColor` function to change cell background colors.
- Enhanced the formula test UI by adding a parameter description table and highlighting key cells with color.
- Completed internationalization by moving all hardcoded strings from components into the translation files.
