feat(UX): Implement interactive range selection

- Implemented interactive range selection in the XLOOKUP formula test.
- Users can now click on an input field and select a range directly in the worksheet.
- Used `onSelectionChanged` event and `useRef` for a robust implementation that avoids re-rendering issues.
