feat(UX): Clear cell highlights on lesson step change

- Added `clearAllRangeFills` function to `excelFormatters.js` to remove all cell background colors.
- Integrated `clearAllRangeFills` into `Lesson.js` to clear highlights when navigating between lesson steps.
- Applied interactive range selection and synchronized cell highlighting to `XlookupMultipleSearch.js`.
- Corrected the interactive range selection logic in `XlookupFormulaTest.js` to use `useRef` for stable event handling.
