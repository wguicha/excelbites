Fix: Load correct App component and improve debugging

- Modified `taskpane.js` to import `App.jsx` from the `components` folder instead of the old `App.js`.
- Removed the unused `App.js` file to prevent confusion.
- Added no-cache headers to `taskpane.html` to aid debugging by preventing aggressive caching in the Office add-in webview.
