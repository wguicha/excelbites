feat(UI): Finalize styling and button placement; fix App.jsx duplication

- Corrected the `SyntaxError: Identifier 'App' has already been declared` in `App.jsx` by removing the duplicated component definition.
- Applied final styling adjustments to `XlookupIntroduction.js`, `XlookupFormulaTest.js`, `XlookupMultipleSearch.js`, and `XlookupErrorHandling.js` for consistent and compact UI.
- Ensured all action buttons have a consistent `min-width`.
- Adjusted `XlookupFormulaResilience.js` to correctly set the initial lookup value to F5 and write '999' to F5 on mount for error handling demonstration.
- Updated translation keys for 'Move Columns' button for brevity.
- Refined footer navigation to ensure buttons are correctly centered and always visible, with disabled states where applicable.
