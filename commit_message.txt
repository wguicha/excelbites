feat: Add XLOOKUP Error Handling and Formula Resilience lessons

- Created `XlookupErrorHandling.js` to demonstrate XLOOKUP's 4th argument for handling non-found values.
- Created `XlookupFormulaResilience.js` to show how XLOOKUP formulas automatically update when columns are moved.
- Added new translation keys for both new lessons.
- Integrated both new components into the `lessonSteps` array in `App.jsx`.
